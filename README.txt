# Summary

The UD Bambara treebank is a section of the Corpus Référence du Bambara annotated natively with Universal Dependencies.

# Introduction


Bambara (also known as Bamana) is the most widely-spoken language of the Manding language group (Niger-Congo > Mande > Western Mande). It is spoken mainly in Mali by 13-14 million people; 
of these, around four million are L1 speakers. Development of the Bambara Reference Corpus (http://cormand.huma-num.fr/) was started in April 2012 (Vydrin 2013, Maslinsky 2014). 
The corpus includes a non-disambiguated sub-corpus and a disambiguated one. For a current moment, the whole corpus contains about 9 million tokens. 
The corpus was annotated using UD Annotatrix annotation tool (Tyers, Sheyanova, Washington 2018).

Documentation for a treebank is available on UD site (http://universaldependencies.org/bm/dep/).
